NAME
    Data::LUID - Generate guaranteed unique local identifiers

VERSION
    Version 0.010

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::LUID::Table

        my $table = Data::LUID::Table->new( path => 'luid' )

        $luid = $table->make

    A sample run:

DESCRIPTION
    On each call to "->make", Data::LUID::Table will generate a guaranteed
    unique local identifier. Guaranteed because once each identifier is
    generated, it will be stored in a table for future lookup (collision
    avoidance).

    The current backend is BerkeleyDB (let me know if you have a better
    suggestion)

USAGE
  $table = Data::LUID::Table->new( path => <path> )
    The <path> argument (default: "./luid" ) is the location of the table on
    disk. It should be a non-existent path (no file or directory)

    Create a new Data::LUID::Table, saving the table to disk at the given
    <path>

    You should not assume <path> be either a directory or file. The backend
    will use it appropiately (currently, it'll be a directory, since that's
    what BerkeleyDB uses)

  $luid = $table->make
  $luid = $table->next
    Generate the next luid in the sequence

    The current generator is using Data::TUID, so there is no real
    "sequence" per se
